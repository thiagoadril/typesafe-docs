Python SDK

Guides and patterns for working with the TypeSafe Python SDK.

## Calling the System One API

```python
import asyncio
from typesafe_sdk import AsyncTypeSafeClient, Choice, Noul, Score
async def main() -> None:
    async with AsyncTypeSafeClient() as client:
        result = await client.system_one(
            "I was charged twice. Please help ASAP.",
            {
                "billing": Noul(instructions="Is this about billing?"),
                "tone": Choice(
                    instructions="What is the tone?",
                    criteria={"calm": None, "angry": None},
                ),
                "urgency": Score(
                    instructions="How urgent is this?",
                    criteria=["low", "medium", "high"],
                ),
            },
        )
        print(
            result.nouls["billing"].noul,
            result.choices["tone"].choice,
            result.scores["urgency"].score,
        )
asyncio.run(main())
```

```python
from typesafe_sdk import Choice, Noul, Score, TypeSafeClient
client = TypeSafeClient()
state = "I was charged twice. Please help ASAP."
questions = {
    "billing": Noul(instructions="Is this about billing?"),
    "tone": Choice(
        instructions="What is the tone?", criteria={"calm": None, "angry": None}
    ),
    "urgency": Score(
        instructions="How urgent is this?", criteria=["low", "medium", "high"]
    ),
}
result = client.system_one(state, questions)
print(
    result.nouls["billing"].noul,
    result.choices["tone"].choice,
    result.scores["urgency"].score,
)
```

## Typed system_one responses

It is possible to provide a response model to `system_one` to make using the response more *type-safe*:

```python
from typesafe_sdk import Noul, NoulAnswer, SystemOneResponse, TypeSafeClient
class BillingResponse(SystemOneResponse):
    billing: NoulAnswer
with TypeSafeClient() as client:
    result = client.system_one(
        "I was charged twice.",
        {"billing": Noul(instructions="Is this about billing?")},
        response_model=BillingResponse,
    )
    assert 0 <= result.billing.noul <= 1
    assert result.billing == result.nouls["billing"]
    print(result.request_id)
```

### Custom response types

It is also possible to define a completely new response model without inheriting from `SystemOneResponse`:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typesafe_sdk import Noul, NoulAnswer, TypeSafeClient
class BillingAnswers(BaseModel):
    billing: NoulAnswer
class BillingResponse(BaseModel):
    answers: BillingAnswers
result = TypeSafeClient().system_one(
    "I was charged twice.",
    {"billing": Noul(instructions="Is this about billing?")},
    response_model=BillingResponse,
)
assert 0 <= result.answers.billing.noul <= 1
```

## Choosing a model

Inspect the available models:

```python
from typesafe_sdk import TypeSafeClient
print(TypeSafeClient().models.list())
```

Select the model when constructing a client:

```python
client = TypeSafeClient(model="jev")
```

See the [Models resource reference](https://docs.typesafe.ai/sdk/python/api/clients/sync#models-resource) for details.

## Retries

Pass a custom [`RetryPolicy`](https://docs.typesafe.ai/sdk/python/api/retries) as `retry` on the client or per call.

```python
from typesafe_sdk import RetryPolicy, TypeSafeClient
client = TypeSafeClient(retry=RetryPolicy(max_retries=3, backoff_max=0.2, timeout=1.0))
```

```python
from typesafe_sdk import RetryPolicy
client.system_one(
    state, questions, retry=RetryPolicy(max_retries=3, backoff_max=0.2, timeout=1.0)
)
```

## Error handling

Handle [exceptions](https://docs.typesafe.ai/sdk/python/api/exceptions) raised by the SDK:

```python
from typesafe_sdk import TypeSafeAPIError
try:
    client.system_one(state, questions)
except TypeSafeAPIError as error:
    print(error.status, error.request_id)
```

## Logging

The SDK logs to the `typesafe_sdk` logger. Configure it according to [standard logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) guide:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger("typesafe_sdk").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

Or set `TYPESAFE_LOG_LEVEL` to one of `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, or `off` before importing the SDK.

`info` logs one summary line per request; `debug` also logs request and response headers and bodies. Secret headers — authorization, API keys, cookies, and any header whose name contains `token` or `secret` — are redacted from log output. Request and response bodies are **not** redacted.

## Environment variables

The SDK reads and uses the following environment variables:

| Variable                 | Configures                                          | Default                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`       | API key (required)                                  | —                         |
| `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL`      | API root URL                                        | `https://api.typesafe.ai` |
| `TYPESAFE_DEFAULT_MODEL` | Default model                                       | `jev-latest`              |
| `TYPESAFE_LOG_LEVEL`     | `typesafe_sdk` logger level, applied once at import | unset                     |

See the [constants reference](https://docs.typesafe.ai/sdk/python/api/constants) for SDK defaults.

## Forward compatibility

The SDK keeps working as the TypeSafe API evolves, so you can adopt new API features before an SDK release adds first-class support for them.

### Extra request fields

Send request fields this SDK version predates with [`extra_body`](https://docs.typesafe.ai/sdk/python/api/clients/sync):

```python
from typesafe_sdk import Noul, TypeSafeClient
with TypeSafeClient() as client:
    client.system_one(
        "I was charged twice.",
        {"billing": Noul(instructions="About billing?")},
        extra_body={"beam_width": 4},
    )
```

### Raw question dictionaries

```python
from typesafe_sdk import TypeSafeClient
with TypeSafeClient() as client:
    client.system_one(
        "I was charged twice.",
        {"billing": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "About billing?", "weight": 2}},
    )
```

**Tip**

Unknown fields are a forward-compatibility escape hatch. Ignore their type-checking errors and prefer upgrading the SDK instead.

### Unknown answer kinds

The SDK logs a warning and skips unrecognized answer kinds. Use `raw_http_response` to inspect the complete API response, including those answers:

```python
from typesafe_sdk import Noul, TypeSafeClient
result = TypeSafeClient().system_one(
    "I was charged twice.",
    {"billing": Noul(instructions="Is this about billing?")},
)
raw_answers = result.raw_http_response.json()["answers"]
```

### Unknown response fields

Unknown extra fields on recognized responses are ignored.
